# üìÑ About

The project **Casa Criativa** is a web application where we can register several ideas of activities that can be done in moments of confinement, for example.<br>To register an ideia, we inform a title, a category(film, series, HQ, course, etc), select an image for the idea, put a brief description and add a link that will lead to that idea on the internet.

If any information in the registration is incorrect, it is possible to delete the idea and register again(the possibility of editing has not been implemented)

It was developed during **Rocketseat's WorkshopDev**. However, i added some features:
- Addition of the image upload field.
- Deleting and idea.
- Confirmation screens for adding and deleting an idea.
- Confirmation before deleting an idea.
- Responsiveness application.
